Performing data analysis on Kickstarter to uncover trends
- Overview of Project

- Louise’s fundraising event for her play almost reached its goal. The Kickstarter data set will show the Outcomes based on goals, outcomes based on launched dates, and there funding goals.

- Analysis and Challenges

	Within the Kickstarter spreadsheet the years column was created based on the "Date Created Conversion" column.
	A pivot table was created with filters, columns, rows, and values.
	The theater campaign results were sorted in descending order.
	A line chart was created showing the project results.
	
- Pivot table theater outcome results

- The challenges a person can experience with an excel spreadsheet could be that the formulas are very precise. 
If you don’t use PEMDAS your results can be random. When you use the exact match symbol your code will pull results that match the test results required.



- Results
-	What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?

-	May and June are the most successful months for theater.
-	December would not be a good launch date based on the results.

-	What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
-	The fund raising results are reached when the funding goals are lower. However, there is an exception to the funding goal of $35,000 – $44,999  

-	What are some limitations of this dataset?
-	With the rise of streaming services it can be difficult to determine when people want to stay home and watch a play or go in person to the theater

-	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

- 	A pie chart.
